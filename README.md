## 💡 Inspiration

ReWear was inspired by a simple, emotional realization: while many of us have closets filled with unused clothes, countless people are in need of decent clothing. This gap led to the creation of a sustainable, tech-driven solution to promote a circular economy, empathy, and environmental responsibility.
